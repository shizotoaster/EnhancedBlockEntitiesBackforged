## Enhanced Block Entities (Backforged)

EBE is a **100% client side** Minecraft mod for the **[Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/)** mod loader which aims to increase the performance of block entity rendering, as well as offer customizability via resource packs. Fork of [EBE](https://github.com/FoundationGames/EnhancedBlockEntities) by FoundationGames. <br/><br/>
**How does it work?** EBE Makes some block entities use baked block models rather than laggy entity models. <br/><br/>
**Is it just an optimization mod?** EBE isn't *just* an optimization mod, some side effects of its optimizations are many visual improvements. <br/>
These may include:
- Smooth lighting on block entities
- Being able to remodel block entities with block models
- Toggling features like christmas chests
- Being able to see block entities from as far away as possible
<br/><br/>

**What about animations?** The best part about EBE is that you still get to keep animations, while gaining the performance boost of baked models! Most animated block entity models will only render when absolutely necessary. <br/><br/>
**Can I use it with Embeddium or Rubidium?** Yes you can, Indium is included in the ForgedAPI Fork <br/><br/>

A decent frame rate increase! (I'm too lazy to count the percentage)

## Resource Packs
You can edit EBE's block entity models using resource packs, since they have been converted to conventional .json block models. <br/>
